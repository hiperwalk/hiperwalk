Development
===========

HiperWalk is built upon several Python libraries. 
Before developing for HiperWalk, these libraries need to be installed. 
The required libraries include
`numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_,
`scipy <https://scipy.org/>`_,
`networkx <https://networkx.org/>`_, and
`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.
To install these libraries, use the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip3 install numpy
   pip3 install scipy
   pip3 install networkx
   pip3 install matplotlib

The ``main`` branch is the main development area for new features. 
To contribute, first clone the repository.

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/hiperwalk/hiperwalk.git

Next, make the desired modifications and submit a pull request.

Testing
=======

Tests are located in the ``hiperwalk/tests/`` directory.
If a complete installation (including HPC support) was performed, 
execute:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./run_all.sh

If you installed the standalone version (without HPC support), 
execute:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./run_nonhpc.sh

Bug Report and Contact
======================

To send a bug report or
contribute to Hiperwalk or contact the developers, 
write an email to hiperwalk@gmail.com.

Documentation
=============

There are likely to be new features in the ``main`` branch. 
These features are documented online in the  **latest** version.

Install Requirements
--------------------

To generate the current, under-development documentation locally, 
all HiperWalk requirements must be installed
(see :ref:`HiperWalk section in the installation guide
<docs_install_hiperwalk>`).

Assuming that all HiperWalk requirements are installed (see *TODO*), 
the following commands install the remaining documentation-specific requirements.

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo apt install python3-sphinx
   sudo apt install graphviz
   pip3 install numpydoc
   pip3 install sphinx-autodoc-typehints
   pip3 install pydata-sphinx-theme

Generate Documentation
----------------------

Within the ``hiperwalk/docs/`` directory, execute:


.. code-block:: shell

   ./go

View Generated Documentation
----------------------------

If the process was successful, the newly compiled documentation 
is now available for local access. To view (and test) it, open the 
file  ``hiperwalk/docs/build/html/index.html``
in your preferred browser -- for instance, by double-clicking on it.

Todo
====
* Releases notes.
* The current version was tested with Ubuntu 20.04.
  Hiperwalk failed to be configured in Ubuntu 22.04.
* The current version only works with GTK 3.0.
  Implementation using GTK 4.0 is postponed to the next release.
